SFML Test
=========

This is a more complex test of SFML. I have used this as an example of
how I imagine a scene-based game system.

The main loop is in SceneManager::play(). The scene manager implements
a stack of scenes, where the top scene is what is rendered
currently. This can easily be extended for things like a main menu
that are then just put onto the stack, and when youâ€™re done, you
return to the level scene.

Sprites are implemented as actors in this model.
